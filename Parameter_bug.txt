German cockroach

Some properties:
cannot survive severe cold
cannot fly
nocturnal, occasionally appears by day
Life cycle: egg -> nymph -> adult (only adult can reproduce)
Lay egg area: German cockroaches carry their eggs with them until they are ready to hatch. When itâ€™s time for hatching, the female cockroach will drop the ootheca wherever she is.


Update every day

Parameters:
maxEggs = 30-40 eggs in each ootheca; in a lifetime, almost 4-8 ootheca -> female)

hatch_age = 15-30 days (average gestation period: egg -> nymph 28 days) 
			for each egg, randomly choose the reproducation age and death age
reproduction_age = 47-132 days (40-125 days/ also another reference shows 40-84 days for nymph -> adult, a week after becoming an adult, it can reproduce)
				   probability
death_age = 100-200 days; (3-6 months, female German cockroaches may live for more than 200 days.)
			probaility


reproduction_probability = ; 2-3 times in a life
hatch_probability = ; (maybe do not need to consider this? only consider the final number of numph)

hunger increase in a time step: (without food and water, will die in 2 weeks)
				nymph can live without food for 1 week;
				between nymph and adult, linear increase
				adult can live without food for 1 month;

reproduction_hunger = ; (continuous no food for two weeks, cannot reproduce)

death_hunger = 1

hunger_decrease due to food: not 1 but percentage


NOT specific:
nocturnal, occasionally appears by day
move_out_of_hiding_place_probability = 0.1;
move_randomly_at_day_probability = 0.01;
move_randomly_at_night_probability = 0.9;(ok)
change_room_probability = 0.1;
