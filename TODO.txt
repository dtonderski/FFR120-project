0. Overall
	a) work on main_realistic
	b) age of first bugs - not zero
	c) 

1. Bug behaviour
	d) make realistic parameters (German cockroach (link in Slack))
		i) when you find a source for a parameter, put the parameter, value and source 			(Ruxin)
		into parameters.txt										
	e) probability of bug changing room should be higher if there is not food in room			(David) DONE
	f) bug shouldn't move out of hiding place if there are humans in the room				(David)				
	g) all(?) movement probabilities should scale with hunger						(Ruxin)
	h) change hunger part											(Ruxin) URGENT	
	i) think about movement at night - should probably prioritize food					(David)			

2. Human behaviour												(Joakim)
									
3. House
	a) hiding spots												(Joakim)
	b) design of the house											(Joakim)
	c) add human behavior to another person									(Joakim)
3. Food

4. Bug control													(David)		
	a) pesticide												
		i) can be put in hiding spots
		ii) probability

5. Statistics - what plots?
	a) Number of bugs ( time )
	b) Heatmap of bug position

6. Environment													(Joakim)
	a) add time constant											(Joakim) URGENT
	b) move environment updating to environment class							(Joakim)	
									
7. Documentation
	a) Write all parameters in parameters.txt								

8. Possible optimizations
	a) house.get_food_locations_in_current_room could be optimized, as the bug now knows which room it is in
	b) change house class so that room_list variable is consistent (separate wall_list and door_list, for example)
