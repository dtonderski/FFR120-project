1. Bug behaviour
	d) make realistic parameters (German cockroach (link in Slack))
		i) when you find a source for a parameter, put the parameter, value and source 					(Everyone)
		into parameters.txt										
	i) at night - regular move, but with 10(?) times probabilities								(Ruxin)
	j) don't move into rooms with humans											(David)
	j) idea - maybe bug should move according to the same algorithm at night, but all probabilities should be higher? 	
	k) sleeping is working													(David)
	l) probabilities are multiplied with some kind of hunger factor								(Ruxin)

2. Human behaviour
	a) de-hardcode food stuffs												(Joakim)
	b) cleaning (Roulette wheel)												(Joakim)
	c) more realistic parameters												(Everyone) 
					
3. House

3. Food

4. Bug control															(David)	
	a) pesticide												
		i) can be put in hiding spots
		ii) probability

5. Statistics - what plots?													(David)
	a) Plot bug steady state vs average food available at night start							(David)

6. Environment															(Joakim)

7. Documentation
	a) Write all parameters in parameters.txt														

8. Possible optimizations
	a) house.get_food_locations_in_current_room could be optimized, as the bug now knows which room it is in
	b) change house class so that room_list variable is consistent (separate wall_list and door_list, for example)		(David) 
	c) set a flag if room contains a human
	d) don't move out of hiding place with human
9. Report
	a) First report draft													(Joakim/David)
