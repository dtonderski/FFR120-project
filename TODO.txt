1. Bug behaviour
	d) make realistic parameters (German cockroach (link in Slack))
		i) when you find a source for a parameter, put the parameter, value and source 			(Ruxin)
		into parameters.txt										
	g) all(?) movement probabilities should scale with hunger						(Ruxin) DONE (a bit different, threshold)
	i) think about movement at night - should probably prioritize food, big probability of changing room	(David)
	j) maybe don't move into rooms with humans?	
	k) if bug isn't hidden and there's a human in the room, the bug should die				(David) DONE (probability)
	l) adult age should be 40-80 days									(Ruxin) URGENT
 

2. Human behaviour												(Joakim) URGENT
	a) add sleeping property										(Joakim)
	b) change bedroom property to bedroom_name								(Joakim)
	c) more realistic parameters										(Joakim)
	d) clean percentage-wise										(Joakim)
					
3. House

3. Food

4. Bug control													(David)	
	a) pesticide												
		i) can be put in hiding spots
		ii) probability

5. Statistics - what plots?											(David)
	a) Number of bugs ( time )										(David) DONE
	b) Heatmap of bug position										(David) DONE

6. Environment													(Joakim)
	b) move environment updating to environment class							(Joakim)	

7. Documentation
	a) Write all parameters in parameters.txt														

8. Possible optimizations
	a) house.get_food_locations_in_current_room could be optimized, as the bug now knows which room it is in
	b) change house class so that room_list variable is consistent (separate wall_list and door_list, for example)	(David) 
	c) set a flag if room contains a human
	d) de-hardcode hunger parameters										(NOT URGENT)
